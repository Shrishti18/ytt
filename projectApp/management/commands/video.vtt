00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
A question I get asked surprisingly often is, is veritasium a real element?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Nope. I made it up.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
When I was a kid, about 10 or 11 years old, I went to this Genghis Khan exhibit at a museum

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
and I didn't know much about Genghis Khan except he was some famous warrior who lived a long time ago

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
so I was thinking maybe we'd see his mummified body or his suit of armor or his sword, something like that

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
but when I got to the museum all they had were like these tiny fragments of pottery and some old shoes

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
and I was incredibly disappointed.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
So in this video I want to tell you my story, but with real pieces of my life.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Real photons that bounced off my face hit a sensor, created a current that created a magnetic field

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
flipping some domains on magnetic tape which was later replayed, recreated and the current passed into a computer digitized

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
into zeros and ones beamed to your device which recreates the light that's hitting your eyes right now.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Now there is a direct path of particles from my 4 year old face to yours right now

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
and there is nothing you can do to undo that.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
I grew up in Vancouver, Canada so I'm mostly Canadian, mostly because my family was South African.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
After my parents got married they moved to Vancouver where my two older sisters were born

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
but I was born in Australia and that's because my dad was working there as an engineer at a pulp and paper mill at the time.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
This is the first house where I ever lived. I lived there for the first 18 months of my life.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Soon after my family returned to Canada and I guess I was a competitive kid

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
because I graduated top of my class and had a full scholarship to go and study engineering at Queen's University.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
The problem was I didn't really want to be an engineer. I wanted to be a filmmaker.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
But there isn't a straightforward path to becoming a filmmaker like there is for becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Plus your chance of success at filmmaking is very low, especially in the year 2000

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
when your best bet is probably to become a PA and try to catch a break somewhere.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
It didn't feel like a meritocracy or like your life was in your own hands.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
So what did I do? Well I did the smart thing. I took the scholarship and completed a degree in engineering physics.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
You know some people seem to think it's strange to have interest in both science and film

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
but to me they are both incredible ways of getting at the truth.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
I mean film records everything exactly as it happens and it never changes so it's like this perfect observation.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
So you can't fool yourself later like about how I felt stifled by four years of engineering.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I feel like I've been stifled by four years of engineering.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
Now while I was at college I did take a few film production courses as many as I could squeeze into my engineering timetable.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
My final project was a film about someone who is really good at math but really wants to be an artist.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
So that's really painfully autobiographical.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
I also made videos with my engineering friends but they always wanted to do something with a gimmick like vampires, ninjas, bigfoot,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
private eyes, pirates.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The videos weren't very good and we didn't even post them to YouTube.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Why not? Well because YouTube didn't exist yet.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
So after the engineering degree I decided to move to Australia and go to film school.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
See the Lonely Planet Guide and the film school application on my desk?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm leaving in five days and I've done barely anything to get ready.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
But once I got to Australia I figured I needed to get a job and get some film experience before I could make a decent application.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
I mean they weren't just going to accept this Canadian engineer with some ridiculous videos.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
And on my sixth day in the country I auditioned for and got a role in this play at the University of Sydney.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
And then I started asking around about physics tutoring work and within a couple weeks I had enrolled in

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
a PhD in the School of Physics.

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
So it seems like a kind of funny place to be in given that I came here to do film but after a short time I realized how much I still

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
liked learning and how much I liked physics and I was hoping that I could meld the two of physics and film.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
In a PhD about how to make films that actually teach physics.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Now I know that sounds incredibly relevant now but at the time it didn't really satisfy either of my passions in physics

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
or film. I know because this is me the night the data first starts coming in from students watching videos that contain

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
misconceptions.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
I just think that you know including extra material that is wrong and stuff into multimedia segments is just something that

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
no one's ever going to really put time and energy into and it's never really going to be worth much and that sort of

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
pisses me off and I wish I was doing something a bit more practical.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
After I got my PhD I applied to the film school.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Now I feel like I'm ready to become an after-student.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And got rejected. I got rejected again the next year.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I applied twice to the drama school but never made it past callbacks.

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
I was looking for that well-defined path toward a creative career but failing at that I did the smart thing and I took a job as the

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
head of science at a tutoring company where I'd been teaching during my PhD.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
They were making motor.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
And it was a great job. I loved the students and the other teachers and the flexibility I had.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
The pay was great.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
And so at the end of 2010 my friends were a bit confused when I told them I was quitting full-time work to start a YouTube channel.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
But I guess I had reached a kind of breaking point.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
I was 28 years old and I'd spent my whole life up to then building backup plans and doing the things that were most likely to

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
succeed engineering and a PhD and teaching. And I wanted to make this shift.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
It was like a shift in life philosophy towards pursuing wholeheartedly the things that I felt to be true.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
The things that I'd always told myself I wanted to do.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
The things I told myself I wanted to be.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I wanted to aim for that and not just something that was safe.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
A good strategic decision in the moment.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
So is veritasium a real element?

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Well for me it was. It was that idea that I wanted to pursue things I felt to be true.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Now you'd think that this would be the triumphant moment from which I'd never look back.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
But the truth is I wasn't very good at making YouTube videos.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
It attracts any object with mass towards any other object with mass.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I was stiff an online science video blog.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
My presentation style was unnatural and the pacing was slow.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Fiji water has been recommended to me by a friend.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
For example the mass of the sun.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Sometimes I think it's a blessing not to know how bad you are because if I had known I probably would have quit.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
But I didn't and so I kept working at it and after a couple of years well I started making enough money on YouTube

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
that I could stop doing all other work. So YouTube became my main source of livelihood.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
And from that point on I've done so many amazing things that I never could have imagined.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
And the greatest adventure by far is one that I haven't told you about.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
But it's when I moved to LA and met a girl and fell in love and...

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Rika. Will you marry me?

08:01.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
And here we are.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Can you fly the drone?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Can you go outside?

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
Now my ability to do what I love every day is all thanks to you.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
And I know that may sound cheesy but it is absolutely true that every video view and like and comment and share

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
all of that great stuff is what has made Veritasium and by extension my life possible.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
So seriously thank you.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
And I guess I owe a debt of gratitude to YouTube because they've made possible something that was unimaginable

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
in the year 2000 when I graduated from high school and it still didn't exist in 2004 when I graduated from college.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
And I think about the people who are currently in high school and college and I think

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
well the job that you will have may not have been invented yet or you may invent it.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
So what is the point of my story? Is it to say if you follow your dreams anything is possible?

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Hardly. Because I'm all too aware of the survivor bias.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
That is if you look at the subset of people who are successful at a particular thing

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
well you're kind of ignoring all the experience of the many more people who did not manage to succeed.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
So when I see actors talking about oh just you know pursue your dreams and you can do anything

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
it feels really wrong like there's this statistical bias in it.

09:45.000 --> 09:53.000
But at the same time I feel like there's a paradox to the survivor bias because the one thing you know about the people who survived

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
are that they attempted in the first place that they ignored the logical choice

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
that you know survivor bias would have you believe never try something which is statistically unlikely.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
They ignored that and they went for it anyway.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
So I guess my advice is if there is something you feel you really want to do

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
then you should at least try it and accept that there is a very high probability of failure

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
but better to try than the alternative where you face certain failure.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Now having kids definitely makes it harder to make videos

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
mainly because I want to spend all my time playing with them and not say editing.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
So thank you for being patient as the pace of video uploads has slowed to a crawl.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
But you know having kids has also made me re-evaluate the types of videos I want to be making

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
and what I want to be doing with my time.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
You know this idea of veritasium was an idea where I wanted to focus on the things I really wanted to accomplish

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
and go straight for those.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I think that's a decision you don't just make once but you have to keep making and re-evaluating

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
and that's what I'm doing.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Trying to decide exactly what I want to do next for veritasium.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
If you've got any ideas leave them in the comments below

11:16.000 --> 11:41.000
and thank you for sticking with me as this channel and I evolve.
